# Advent of Code

My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles, written in Rust.
Each year's puzzles are organised into a Cargo workspace consisting of one binary crate per puzzle.
Each puzzle's binary:
* aims to solve the puzzle for any valid input;
* aims to minimise the number of out-of-repository dependencies other than Rust's standard library;
* parses the puzzle input from a file called `input.txt` placed in the crate's root directory.
